# Project Introduction

Our task is to explore our Bank's Marketing campaign and create meaningful insights from the data
The step one should be accessing the data
Our data has been curated by UCI Machine Learning Repository which is an excellent datahouse of various real world problems!
We are going to use the Banking Data described by our friends in UCI here

: Load the dataset into the notebook
: Explore and make note of Attribute Information from UCI
: What is the significance of the y column in the dataset and what are the value counts of the y column?
: What is the ratio of the two classes ? Are they balanced ?

: Get the dtypes of all the columns of our dataset
: Refering to the UCI data description , explore the data in your columns and check if there are any errors
: Make note of the deviation in the dataset compared to the description provided by UCI
: Using Data Cleaning principles you learned from Pandas Tutorial) figure out the best ways to get rid of the dirty data Part V : Print the cleaned data
Use the groupby function on the mean of the following columns :
: y
:job
:marital
